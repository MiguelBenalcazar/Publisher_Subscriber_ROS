# Publisher_Subscriber_ROS
Handling Publisher and Subscriber in ROS using an only python script
There are 3 important files:
talker.py ---> this file will publish "hi" which will be read by the talker_edited.py and this last will publish the Word "HOLA" which will be read by the listener.py
the following rqt_graph image shows how is the process.
